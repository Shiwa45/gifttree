# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The product detail page currently has non-functional JavaScript buttons for core e-commerce features. Users can view product information but cannot interact with key features like adding to cart, managing wishlist, checking delivery availability, or purchasing products. This feature will connect the existing frontend interface to the Django backend APIs to enable full e-commerce functionality.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to add products to my cart from the product detail page, so that I can purchase them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "ADD TO CART" button THEN the system SHALL send an AJAX request to add the product to their cart
2. WHEN the product is successfully added THEN the system SHALL display a success message and update the cart count in the header
3. WHEN a user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page before adding to cart
4. WHEN the product is out of stock THEN the system SHALL display an error message and disable the add to cart button
5. IF the product has variants THEN the system SHALL require variant selection before adding to cart

5. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL check if the product is already in the user's wishlist and update the icon accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to check if delivery is available to my pincode, so that I can confirm the product can be delivered to my location.
