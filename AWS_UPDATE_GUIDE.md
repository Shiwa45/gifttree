# AWS Deployment Update Guide

## 🚀 Quick Update Process

Since your Django project is already deployed on AWS, here's how to update the files to fix the cart bugs:

## 📋 Files Modified (Cart Bug Fixes)

### 1. **templates/products/product_detail.html**
- Fixed `addToCart()` function to make actual AJAX calls
- Added form submission handlers to prevent page redirects
- Updated both desktop and mobile forms

### 2. **apps/cart/views.py**
- Fixed redirect URL from `cart:cart_view` to `cart:cart`

## 🔧 Update Methods

### Method 1: Direct File Upload (Recommended)
```bash
# Upload modified files to your AWS server
scp templates/products/product_detail.html user@your-server:/path/to/project/
scp apps/cart/views.py user@your-server:/path/to/project/
```

### Method 2: Git Pull (If using Git)
```bash
# SSH into your AWS server
ssh user@your-server

# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Or if you need to pull specific files
git checkout HEAD -- templates/products/product_detail.html
git checkout HEAD -- apps/cart/views.py
```

### Method 3: Manual Copy-Paste
1. **SSH into your AWS server**
2. **Edit files directly** using nano/vim
3. **Copy the updated code** from the modified files

## 🔄 After Uploading Files

### 1. **Restart Your Web Server**
```bash
# For Gunicorn
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn

# For uWSGI
sudo systemctl restart uwsgi

# For Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2

# For Nginx (if used)
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 2. **Clear Python Cache** (Optional)
```bash
# Remove Python cache files
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
```

### 3. **Collect Static Files** (If needed)
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

## 🧪 Test the Fixes

### 1. **Test Product Detail Page**
- Go to any product page
- Click "Add to Cart" button
- Should show success message without redirect
- Cart badge should update

### 2. **Test Cart Page**
- Go to cart page
- Click "Quick Add" on recommended products
- Should add to cart without errors

### 3. **Test Mobile**
- Test on mobile device
- Both desktop and mobile "Add to Cart" should work

## 🐛 What Was Fixed

### Before (Issues):
- ❌ "Add to Cart" showed fake success message
- ❌ Products were added but showed error message
- ❌ Page redirected to products page with error
- ❌ Cart page "Quick Add" didn't work

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ Real AJAX calls to server

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

### Check Logs:
```bash
# Check Django logs
tail -f /var/log/django/error.log

# Check web server logs
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
# or
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
```

### Common Issues:
1. **File permissions**: Ensure files are readable by web server
2. **Cache**: Clear browser cache and Django cache
3. **Static files**: Run `collectstatic` if needed
4. **Server restart**: Make sure web server is restarted

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server logs for Python errors
3. Verify file permissions
4. Ensure all files were uploaded correctly
